# Python-Assignment-3
Rewriting python assignment as jupyter server isn't cooperating



Had to mess arround with the euler and rk4 functions such that their last entry would always corrospond to tmax such that I could evaluate the analytic and numerical results at the same time value.

run main (compiled from main.rs) to generate values in difference2.dat then use the gnuplot script to generate the graph. The graph can be seen in result!.pdf
